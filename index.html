        Machine Learning (ML) systems are increasingly being used in many domains, including robotics, transportation, manufacturing, and even safety-critical fields such as healthcare, among others, primarily due to their impressive performance. However, despite the remarkable performance and many applications, ML systems may have many pitfalls. For example, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), one of the best performing ML techniques, can be fooled to malfunction by just applying a small perturbation to the data, indicating that these techniques are not robust. 
        Further, incidents have been reported where the ML decisions were unfair and hurt people in the minority or historically disadvantaged groups. Troubleshooting such issues with some of the best performing ML systems (e.g., DNNs) is also not possible due to their black-box nature; developers or the users of these systems cannot understand how the system works and the reasons behind its decisions. In other words, they are not human interpretable. Furthermore, unlike standard software systems, the validity of operations of an ML system cannot be formally verified against a user specification. To address these issues, the ML community has extensively researched techniques to make ML systems trustworthy because when deployed in the real world, human lives may depend on these systems. 
        The umbrella covering interpretability, robustness, fairness, and verifiability of ML systems is commonly referred to as trustworthy ML.
