title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Smart City Applications.

description: |
With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) architectures, we find many interesting applications enhancing our day-to-day lives, such as smart cities, wearable devices, and industrial automation. Such IoT applications utilize the expressive power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), to provide improved functionality and user experience. For instance, state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Systems in smart city applications are powered by Deep Learning techniques.

With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) architectures, we find many interesting applications enhancing our day-to-day lives, such as smart cities, wearable devices, and industrial automation. Such IoT applications utilize the expressive power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), to provide improved functionality and user experience. For instance, state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Systems in smart city applications are powered by Deep Learning techniques.

Despite the impressive performance, state-of-the-art AI techniques come at the cost of interpretability. Humans cannot comprehend how these AI techniques, such as DNNs, transform the input data into the output they provide. Since IoT applications directly interact with the public and may be deployed for mission-critical domains, it is vital to explain the decisions made by AI systems in those applications. Further, such explanations must be understandable to all stakeholders irrespective of AI or computer science literacy (e.g., elders taken care of by remote monitoring systems) to make IoT applications trustworthy and increase their adaptation in the real world. In this project, we develop techniques to explain the decisions of AI systems for smart city applications.
